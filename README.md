# Customer-Segmentation-using-K-means-Clustering
Today’s business runs based on the ability to captivate the customers with the products, but with such a large raft of products leave the customers puzzled, what to buy and what to not and also the companies are doubtful about what section of customers to target to sell their products. This is where machine learning comes in handy, various algorithms are applied for unraveling the hidden patterns in the data for better decision making for the future. This eludes the concept of which segment to target is made unequivocal by applying segmentation. The process of segmenting the customers with similar behaviors into the same segment and with different patterns into different segments is called customer segmentation. In this paper, 3 different clustering algorithms (k-Means, Agglomerative, and Meanshift) are been implemented to segment the customers and finally compare the results of clusters obtained from the algorithms. A python program has been developed and the program is been trained by applying a standard scaler onto a dataset having two features of 200 training samples taken from the local retail shop. Both the features are the mean of the amount of shopping by customers and average of the customer’s visit into the shop annually.
